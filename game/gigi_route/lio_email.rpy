"""Hello [name]!

My name is Lio, and Cecilia Immergreen recommended me to you, 
in which I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity!
I critic food, but Ms. Immergreen likely mentioned my distaste for coffee.
Sorry if I seem really rigid, this is my first time being invited to a Justice HQ event!
I do have one question though, what type of food will be provided?
Obviously I'm a food critic, so I just want to know if some of my favorites will be there.

Thank you!
Lio"""
