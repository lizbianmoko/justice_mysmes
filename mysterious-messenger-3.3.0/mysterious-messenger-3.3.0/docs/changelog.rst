    :widths: 15, 85
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Feature**
      - **Description**
    * - Remember save page
      - The game remembers which save page you last used.
    * - Main Menu Screen Actions
      - Common actions for buttons on the main menu and home screen have been turned into functions for easier UI modification.
    * - Check for updates in thread
      - The updater launches a separate thread to check for updates so the UI is not paused/frozen while waiting for the results of the check.
    * - ``gamestate``
      - Whether the program is in a chatroom, phone call, VN/Story Mode, or text message is tracked via a consistent `gamestate` variable.
    * - Available call indicator
      - A new dev option will add a "NEW" sign under a contact's icon when there is a call available for them and add an ``Online`` indicator on their profile screen.
    * - :ref:`get_terms<Using Gendered Terms>`
      - Convenience function for using gendered terms to refer to the player.
    * - Developer Release Options
      - Added a section to ``variables_editable.rpy`` which can be customized for sharing a program distribution with others.
    * - :ref:`Email newlines<Writing an Email Chain>`
      - You can turn off the parser that turns email single newlines into a space (``email_newline_to_space``).
    * - :ref:`Gallery update<CG Albums>`
      - The gallery has been redone to cause fewer headaches overall and requires one definition instead of two.
    * - ``big`` text tag
      - There is now a ``{big}`` text tag which can be used similarly to how ``big`` is used for the msg CDS.
    * - Popup updates
      - Popups have been updated to take advantage of screen tags. An infinite number of popups of any type can be on screen at any time (so, no more restrictions on how many text message popups, heart icons, or stackable notifications etc you can see at once).

.. _incompat-3-3-0:

Incompatible
--------------------

* While not strictly incompatible, the gallery system has been updated to use constants rather than both a default and a persistent album variable. The game will attempt to transfer over any unlocked photos from the old gallery version into the new one. It is recommended that you update your gallery definitions to use ``define`` and the new ``GalleryImage`` class rather than ``Album``. You can find more information :ref:`in the docs on the gallery.<Defining a CG>`

3.0.0
=======

.. _major-3-0-0:

Major New Features
--------------------

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15, 85
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Feature**
      - **Description**
    * - StoryMode
      - Story Mode sections can exist separately from chatrooms and take a trigger time and a title. This also replaces the previous `VNMode` class.
    * - StoryCall
      - Phone calls can appear in the timeline and be mandatory for story progression. If a story call expires, the character will leave a voicemail. Story calls can exist on their own with a trigger time or can be attached to Story Mode sections or chatrooms. Only one story call per character is allowed, but multiple story calls with different callers can exist on the same timeline item.
    * - `msg` CDS
      - A new way of writing chatroom and text message dialogue. Automatically adds text tags and parses emojis as images. Can also add new speech bubbles and fonts to work with this CDS.
    * - `text backlog` CDS
      - Allows messages to be added as "backlog" to a character's text message conversation history. Can manually set the date/time the message appears, relative to the current date/time.
    * - `compose text` CDS
      - Replaces calls like `call compose_text(r)` and `call compose_text_end("menu_a2")`. Makes it easier to set up and write text messages, and even schedule when they should be delivered.
    * - Choice paraphrasing
      - Can turn `paraphrase_choices` on or off on a global, per-menu, or per-choice basis to dictate whether or not the program should automatically make the main character say the dialogue in the selected choice.
    * - Bonus profile pictures
      - Characters have bonus profile pictures that are unlocked based on user-defined conditions or when seen in-game. NPC profile pictures cost 5 heart points with that character to unlock, and player profile pictures cost 1 hourglass. These values are modifiable.
    * - Profile picture callback
      - When the player changes their profile picture, a special function is called that allows the characters to comment on their profile picture choice (e.g. by phoning them or sending a text message)
    * - `scene` and `show` extention
      - `scene` and `show` have been extended to allow chatroom backgrounds to be set with `scene morning` instead of `call chat_begin('morning')`. Most other effects, such as banners, can be shown via `show` commands like `show banner heart` or `show hack effect`.
    * - `timed menu` CDS
      - Timed menus are now typed like regular menus. The dialogue before the first choice will dictate how long the timer is. Choices are shown on-screen while the characters continue messaging. A preferences option turns timed menus into regular menus, and a slider allows for timed menu "bullet time" so that the chat speed can be fast but timed menus slow down to give players time to read.
    * - Email system improvements
      - Email chains can be of an arbitrary length with any number of replies. Failing an email can still continue an email chain. A string parser makes using triple-quoted strings to type emails much more readable. Players can choose to reply to an email later after clicking Reply.
    * - `call chat_begin` / `jump phone_end`-style calls removed
      - The program handles the setup and cleanup of all timeline items. All labels can simply begin without further ado and all labels can end with `return`.

      - You can now define thumbnails and `-b` variants on thumbnails for gallery images. These variants will be used for bonus profile pictures.

      - Can now add backgrounds to routes in the history screen. A rectangular image will automatically have the corners cropped to fit the button. Can also add prologues through a special variable in `variables_editable.rpy`.
    * - `.webp` and `.ogg` conversion
      - Most images have been converted to `.webp` to reduce file size. Some audio files have been converted to `.ogg` for similar reasons.
    * - `call answer` removed
      - `call answer` is no longer required before a chatroom or text message menu.
    * - `custom_route_select_screen`
      - Can easily switch between a custom route select screen and the default one. Default route select improved to have additional graphics.

    * - Messenger Error screen
      - The program will try to catch operational errors and award the player an hourglass if something fails but it is able to recover.
    * - Viewing CGs
      - Viewing CGs full-screen while on the messenger or viewing a text message now simply halts the game state while it is being viewed instead of manually pausing the chat.
    * - Home screen grid fix
      - The home screen now properly calculates how many pictures it will be showing so the grid is not over- or underfull.

    * - **Feature**
      - **Description**
    * - `play music` and `play sound`
      - New CDSs replace `call play_music()` and `call play_sfx()`. Can be typed and used the same way as the regular Ren'Py function, but is now compatible with audio captions.
    * - Custom ending screens
      - Can now define your own ending image and pass the whole string to the `ending` variable upon ending a route.
    * - `create_incoming_call`
      - Easy way of creating a new incoming call; intended primarily to be used in combination with profile picture callbacks.
    * - Keyboard shortcuts

    * - TimelineItem class
      - All timeline items (chatrooms and VN mode) have been switched to inherit from a base TimelineItem class. The new classes allow for more flexibility such as standalone story calls and story mode sections, and the individual items in a chain can all have a separate `after_` label.
    * - String to filename conversion
      - Guest names and album names can be converted to a filename which the program can search for to find images associated with that name. `all_albums` definitions can be modified to reflect this.
    * - `persistent.testing_mode` improvements
      - Activating `Testing Mode` from the Developer options will now show a button to instantly end a chatroom. It also removes a lot of the confirm-style message and allows you to right-click an item on the timeline to instantly mark it as played for testing purposes.
    * - `persistent.unlock_all_story`
      - An option, Unlock All Story, in the Developer options will make all timeline items immediately available. Plot branches can be proceeded through without playing all prior items.
    * - Save slots
      - Save slots are now paged rather than one long list.
    * - `add_choices` for spaceship thoughts
      - Can now append a new choice to a list of spaceship thoughts.
    * - `main_character` variable
      - A character defined as the main character will say non-paraphrased dialogue automatically and be moved to the right side of the messenger.
    * - `persistent.pv`
      - `pv` (for chatroom speed) is now persistent and will carry over across playthroughs and on the history screens.
