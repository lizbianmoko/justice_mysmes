    Looks like you figured out the phone call function, huh?

    This is a test call for the program. It's always available on Tutorial Day.

    That means you'll never hear my voicemail message, but you can try calling the other characters to hear their voicemail.

    Usually, phone calls will timeout two chatrooms after they're first 'activated'.

    That means you won't be able to phone that character anymore to get that conversation. So be sure to call the characters often!

    You can find much more explanation on this feature and more in the documentation.
